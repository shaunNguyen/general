preinst script is executed before the package is unpacked and installed on the system. It is typically
used to perform pre-installation tasks such as checking system requirements, backing up files, or
stopping services that may conflict with the installation

postinst script is executed after the package has been installed on the system. It is typically used
to perform post-installation tasks such as configuring the package, starting services, or updating
system settings.
