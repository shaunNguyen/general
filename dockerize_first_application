1. Install Docker on your machine

2.  Create your project
Create  a folder on your computer, it's must contain 2 files:
	. "main.py" -> contain the code to be executed 
	. "Dockerfile" -> contain the nescessary instructions to create the environment

3. Edit python file 

4. Edit Dockerfile
A Dockerfile must always start by importing the base image
We use the keywork 'FROM' to do that
In our example, we want to import python image name 'latest' for the version
	FROM python:latest

In order to launch our python code, we must import it into our image
We use the keyword 'COPY' to do that
The first parameter 'main.py' is the name of file on the host
The second param '/' is the path where to put the file on the image
Here we put the file at the image root folder.
	COPY main.py /
We need to define the cmd to launch when we are going to run the image
