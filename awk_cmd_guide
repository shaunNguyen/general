						awk man
>>> examining fields
input: 'This seems like a pretty nice example.'

$1: 'This'
$7: 'example.'
$0: 'This seems like a pretty nice example.'

>>> regular Expression Constants
regular expression constants consist of text describing a regular expression enclosed in slashes (such
as /the answer/) 

>>> escape sequences
all these escape sequences apply to both string constants and regexp constants
\\	Aliteral backslash, '\'
\a 	The 'alert' character, Ctrl-g, ASCII code 7(BEL), this often makes some sort of audible noise
\b 	Backspace, Ctrl-h, ASCII code 8(BS)
\f	Formfeed, Ctrl-I, ASCII code 12(FF)
\n	Newline, Ctrl-j, ASCII code 10 (LF)
\r 	Carriage return, Ctrl-m, ASCII code 13 (CR).
\t 	Horizontal TAB, Ctrl-i, ASCII code 9 (HT)
\v	Vertical TAB, Ctrl-k, ASCII code 11 (VT)
\nnn	The octal value nnn, where nnn stands for 1 to 3 digits between ‘0’ and ‘7’. For example, the code for the ASCII ESC (escape) character is ‘\033’.
\xhh...	
\/	A literal slash (should be used for reexp constants only)
\" 	A literal double quote (should be used for string constants only)

example: 
a1time a2host a3level a4program a5msg

awk '%s' - $1 >= "a1time" $2 == "a2host" $4 ~ \"%s\"
