Networking your docker containers using docker0 bridge :
========================================================
1. Overview 
- how to use and customize the default docker0 bridge -> setup networking for docker containers
- Docker server creates and configures the host system's docker0 as an Ethernet bridge inside Linux kernel
that could be used by the docker containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world
- the docker0 bridge is virtual interface created by the docker, it randomly chooses an address and subnet RFC1918
all the docker containers will be connected to the docker0 bridgeby default
- docker containers connected to the docker0 bridge could use the iptables NAT rules created by the docker 

2. How the docker0 bridge is created ?
docker0 bridge will be created when the docker service is started 

3. docker0 bridge and NAT rules under the hood 
docker0 is a Linux bridge without any real network adapter attached, and configued with ip addr 172.17.0.1/16
Docker also creates the iptables NAT rules on the docker host that could be used by the docker containers
connected to docker0 bridge to connect to the outside world. 

4. Connects the docker containers to docker0 bridge 
by the default Docker will attach all containers to docker0 bridge, so you do not need to specify any additional
flag with docker run cmd to connect the docker containers to the docker0 bridge, unless the DOCKER_OPTS in docker
configuration file explicitly specifies to use the other network than docker0 bridge, this case you could use 

5. customize docker0 bridge :
the default configuration Ã² docker0 works for most of the cases, however, you could custimize the docker0 configuration
per your requirements, the following options of docker0 are configuration at server startup:
--bip=CIDR - supply a specific IP address and netmask for the docker0 bridge, using standard CIDR like 
	192.168.1.5/24
--fixed-cidr=CIDR - restrict the IP range from the docker0 subnet, using the standard CIDR notation like 	
-- mtu=BYTES - override the maximum packet length on docker0
