how #ifdef __cplusplus work ? 
------------------------------
extern "C" - doesn't really change the way that the compiler reads the code
*.c -> be compiled as C 
*.cpp -> as cpp
What extern "C" does is affect linkage 

extern "C" :
============
is used to make a function name that has a link with C, this is a case when the compiler
dosen't mangle the function
Mangling ?
we can have the feature of a function overloading, which we can use to create the function 
with the same name but with different types of arguments and datatypes.

extern "C" second :
===================
refer : https://www.delftstack.com/howto/c/extern-c/
we use the extern keyoword to define glocal variables, also known as external variables, 
and defined outside the method (function) 
when extern keyword us used in the C++ file, a specific function name in C++ has a C linkage.
